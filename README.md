# üõçÔ∏è E-commerce Product Gallery Frontend

This project is a high-quality, robust, well-documented, dynamic, and interactive e-commerce web application built using Vue 3 and Vuetify 3. It showcases a professional design system with a modular structure to keep components singular and maintainable.

## Overview

### Technologies Used

- **Vue 3**: The progressive JavaScript framework.
- **Vuetify 3**: A Vue UI Library with beautifully handcrafted Material Components.
- **Custom theme**: I Made a custom theme in order to keep a good color palette.
- **virtual Component**: This is a Vuetify feature where you config/adjust certain components to avoid re-defining them later on.
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better developer experience.
- **ViteAliases**: Config shortcuts, makes it easy to import things from anywhere :wink: .

### Technical Benefits

- Modular architecture for maintainability and scalability.
- Use of Vuetify 3 for a consistent design system.
- Composables for logic separation and code reuse.
- TypeScript for type safety.

## Project Structure

The project follows a modular structure where each feature or functionality is organized into its module. This helps in maintaining a clean and scalable codebase.

## Separation of Concerns

A key objective of any good frontend application is to keep components singular and separated with minimal code.

For this exercise, I could also use an Atomic architecture, but I believe you would like to see something that allows more flexibility and scalability for large-scale projects (modular monolithic architecture :wink: ).

So this achieved by using the followings :

- **composables**: to handle logic and only keeping only the essentials inside the components.
- **Components** : Vue components for the module.
- **Types**: TypeScript type definitions.
- **API**: Service files for API calls.
